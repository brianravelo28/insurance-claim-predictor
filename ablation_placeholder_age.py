"""Does a better guess for the 11,713 placeholder-date buildings (the FEMA '1492' sentinel) improve the model?

Today those buildings (3.8% of claims) get the overall median age. But every one of them is flagged pre-FIRM (see
ablation_postfirm.py), and "pre-FIRM" is not a fixed age: the known-date pre-FIRM population's median age at loss grows
from 9 years in the 1970s to 54 in the 2020s (it's a fixed construction era getting older). 92% of placeholder rows are
themselves 1970s-80s losses. A single flat "old" constant would misfit most of them; a year-aware value should not.

Imputation tested: for each placeholder row, the median age of KNOWN-date, pre-FIRM claims from the SAME loss year
(falling back to a +/-2-year window, then the pre-FIRM population overall, for years too thin to have their own median).
Scored with the same year-grouped CV and folds as ablation_year_control.py / ablation_postfirm.py.

Run after build_dataset.py:   python ablation_placeholder_age.py   ->  data/ablation_placeholder_age.json
